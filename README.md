## Week 2 -D0cum3nt 4rch1t3ctur3

**Topics Covered:**
- structure
- github organization
- web debreif 

**Key Takeaways:**
I had never used github before this class and learning to use github and how to organize it was quite interesting. The ways to edit the whole workspace and use vs code to imbed and add new things was really cool to learn.

**Projects/Exercises:**
- we used codedex.io and we made a few new html pages using just basic html including making a recipe. We made Wiki articles too, which lead to us making a tribute page using the same person we made the wiki page about.
